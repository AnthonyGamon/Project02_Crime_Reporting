# Project 2: See Something, Say Something

## Description
The user is able to visit the deployed website and is prompted to sign up or log in. Once logged in, the user is able to submit a crime report that records such details as where the crime occurred (location-specific), what crime was committed, and the user's email. Once the user-generated crime report is submitted to the database, it is then posted on the Crimes page. The user is also able to view crimes that have been reported near their specific location (using Google Maps).
